BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Unknown gunmen struck on Friday, killing three policemen of the department of Explosive Ordinance Devices from the Delta State Police Command, Asaba, attached to the State Government House. The murder took place in the Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State when the policemen were on their way to Abia State. According to a police officer attached to the Anambra State command who pleaded for anonymity, they were an advance team of the Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, who is the vice presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party. The names of the three deceased police officers were given as Inspectors Lucky Aleh, Celestine Nwadiokwu and Jude Obuh. Further revelation showed that the gunmen at about 1.30pm also set their vehicle ablaze and that two of the killed police officers were indigenes of Agbor, Delta State. “Four officers were in the vehicle but one was on mufti (not on uniform) so he was freed while the three in uniform were killed. The Escort Commander from the Government House, Asaba, was sent to bring their corpses and deposit in a mortuary in Asaba,” a Government House source said. The Police Public Relations Officer of Anambra State command, Ikenga Tochukeu, confirmed the incident, adding that, “We got distress calls and we rushed to the scene of the incident. The policemen who were killed are from the Delta State command and were on transit as at the time of the incident. But I can assure you that the state commissioner of police, Anambra is very poised to bringing to book the criminals behind the dastardly act.” The Delta State Government House and the state police command are said to have been thrown into mourning over the incident.
