Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has blamed poor logistics arrangements on the part of the Independent National Electoral Commission for the delay in commencement of voting across the state in Saturdayâ€™s election. Senator Diri, who stated this after casting his vote alongside his wife, Dr. Gloria, at ward 6 unit 4 (Kalama-owei wari) in Sampou Community in Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area about 10:30am, urged INEC to address the logistics challenges. His Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as calling on INEC to extend the voting period to accommodate those who could not vote early as a result of the logistics delay. He, however, lauded the performance of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and advocated that Nigeria should move to the next level by introducing electronic voting to check electoral fraud and improve the overall electoral process. The governor also commended the security situation in his community and parts of the state as of the time of voting and lauded the people of the state for their peaceful conduct.
