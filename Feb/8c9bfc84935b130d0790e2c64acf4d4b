The Labour Party has called for the postponement of Saturday’s general elections in Ondo State over absence of its logo in the ballot papers. It said its logo was missing in the ballot papers to be used for elections into Ondo Central Senatorial District and five House of Representative seats. The House of Representatives seat where its logo were missing were Akoko Southwest/Akoko Southeast, Ondo East/Ondo West, Akure North/Akure South, Okitipupa/Irele and Ese-Odo/ Ilaje. Ondo LP Secretary, Abiodun Agbaje, said names of the party’s candidates were sent to INEC but were surprised that the party’s logo was missing from the ballot papers. “Our representative went to INEC for sorting out for electoral materials to be sent to various wards. LP logo was missing for the Senatorial and House of Representatives where we have candidates. INEC should give us opportunity to participate or postpone the election.
 “Our candidates should be given opportunity to exercise their rights. We are here to express our displeasure. We expect INEC to do the needful. It was a deliberate act. I do not think any agency of government supersedes the judiciary that gave us judgment. “Our party primary was conducted across the federation. INEC acknowledged the letter from our party in October last year. You cannot vote without logo of the parry.
Logo of the party appeared in Ondo North. Our candidates were not initially uploaded on the portal on the fault of INEC and not the party. Names of all the candidates were forwarded to INEC,” the party claimed.
