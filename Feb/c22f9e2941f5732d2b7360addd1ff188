A foremost Yewa patriot and Emeritus Professor of History, Anthony Asiwaju, has charged the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress, Biyi Otegbeye, to reverse the trend of project abandonment in Ogun West senatorial district, if elected. Raheem Ajayi, Director of Media and Publicity, Biyi Otegbeye Campaign Council, said in a statement that Asiwaju gave the admonition at the palace of Onimeko of Imeko during the ongoing ADC campaign to Imeko Afon local government area of the state. The renowned international scholar in African border studies, while presenting two of his books to Otegbeye, urged him to “Read the books and underline specific parts because it captures among other things, what we want you to go and do in Oke Mosan, which is to reverse a negative trend”. “The abandonment of Yewa-Awori is much and our area has become a relic of abandoned projects. Go to Ipokia, the polytechnic project there has been abandoned. Look at our roads, most are abandoned. You cannot but cry because there is no entry point to Yewa-Awori land, whether you enter from the north, central, East or south, that is good”. Asiwaju observed that in the 47 years of Ogun State, the West has never been governor and this has got to change soon. He then prayed that, “As you want it that Ogun West should go for governorship now and not later, God will make it happen for you.” In his response, Otegbeye pleaded with Professor Asiwaju to get involved, as usual, in the course. “You are the foremost historian on the continent. History will make itself that a Yewa-Awori man unquestionably stood out to bid for Ogun State governorship at a time some people feel is inappropriate. “The question is, who will stand with and also speak for that man? I seek your support and voice at this time and I assure you that we shall win and I will make use of your advice to correct the stated anomalies.”
