Few weeks after resuming individual training, Sadio Mane is now back to full training session with Bayern Munich teammates. The 30-year old picked up an injury on his right leg in November and missed the World Cup in Qatar. He restarted pitch training by the end of January and was declared not fit by Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann for their UFA Champions league last 16 first leg clash against PSG last Tuesday. Now, the 30-year old is back to full training and played with his teammates on Sunday morning. “The feeling is simply fantastic”, said the former Liverpool forward while rejoining his teammates. Reports in Germany suggest Mane will be available for the return leg of the UEFA Champions league last 16 clash against PSG on March 8. However, before that important game, he could make his comeback against Union Berlin next Sunday or against Stuttgart on Saturday, March 4.
