Gift Orban has made a dream start to his career with KAA Gent, marking his first appearance for The Buffalos with a brace in a six-goal thriller against KVC Westerlo at the weekend. The 2002- born striker arrived at Gent in the January transfer window, and he was given his debut by manager Hein Vanhaezebrouck eleven days after the transfer was completed. After Maxim De Cuyper found the net to equalize for the home team, Orban restored Gent’s one-goal advantage with a spectacular bicycle kick on the half-hour mark, only for Nacer Chadli to level matters in the 35th minute. Two minutes into the second half, Lukas Van Eenoo scored to give KVC Westerlo the lead for the first time in the game, but Orban salvaged a point for the visitors with his second goal of the game in the 66th minute. Orban joined Gent with a huge reputation, ending the 2022 season with nineteen goals in all competitions for Norwegian outfit Stabæk. The 20-year-old’s stats are impressive, considering that this is his second season as a professional. Orban is in contention to make his debut in European competition this coming Thursday when Gent trade tackles with Qarabag in the first leg of the knockout round of the Europa Conference League.
