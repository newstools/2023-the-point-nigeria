BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA The Court of Appeal in Abuja has struck out an appeal by the Allied Peoples Movement, APM, seeking the disqualification of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the forthcoming general election. The Respondents in the appeal are the Independent National Electoral Commission, Labour Party and its Presidential candidate, Peter Obi, as the 3rd respondent. Delivering Judgment, a three-man panel of justices led by Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, unanimously struck out the appeal for lacking in merit. The panel, therefore, ordered the Appellant to pay the cost of N200,000 in favour of each of the 2nd and 3rd respondents.
