BY FESTUS OKOROMADU The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority has threatened to sanction petroleum product retail outlets that fail to accept payments through bank transfers or the use of Point of Sale machines. The regulator in a statement on Thursday said the decision is coming on the heels of findings that the refusal of some filling stations to accept such mode of payment has brought untold hardship upon Nigerians. The statement reads in part, “It has come to the attention of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) that some retail outlets are not accepting the use of Point of Sale (POS) machines at their filling stations due to the recent cash crunch brought about by the new Naira design. “The authority frowns at this recent behaviour which is causing untold hardship for Nigerians at a time when all hands should be on deck to assist the Government in the transition to the new Naira. “All retail outlets are directed to ensure the free use of POS and bank transfer for the sale of petroleum products to alleviate the suffering of customers at this critical time. “The Authority and security agencies will be at retail outlets to ensure compliance with this directive and any filling station found violating this directive will be duly sanctioned. “We reassure the general public of our commitment to ensuring good quality service in the sale and distribution of petroleum products nationwide.”
