He, however, claimed that if not for some “little hitches”, his party would have gotten more votes. Also, the APC agent, Ja’afar Ahmed, complained about the result, insisting that the exercise was characterised by violence, late arrival of election materials, malfunctioning of BVAS as well as inducement in different forms. Responding, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the State, Ahmed Bello-Mahmud expressed appreciation that the elections were conducted peacefully, fairly, credibly and conclusively collated and devoid of any rancour. He appealed to the electorate to maintain the tempo in the forthcoming elections for the good of all.
