BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The leadership of the All Progressives Congress in Osun State has directed its members and supporters to observe a three-day fasting and prayer to seek the favour of God for the smooth conduct of the general elections and the emergence of its candidates. The Acting State Chairman of the party, Tajudeen Lawal, gave the directive in a statement issued by the party’s Director of Media and Information, Kola Olabisi, in Osogbo on Tuesday. Lawal hinted that his party does not joke with the potency of fasting and prayer, saying that the spiritual activities should be held between Wednesday and Friday which is the eve of the of the Presidential and National Assembly elections. He stated that the prayer point of the APC members and supporters should be that, “God Almighty should finish His work which He had started a long time ago on the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and all the the party’s national and state assemblies’ candidates.” Lawal enjoined the APC members to remember in their supplications to God to pray for crisis-free elections and subsequent victory of all the party’s candidates.
