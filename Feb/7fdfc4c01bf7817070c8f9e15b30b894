The senator representing Enugu East Senatorial District and former governor of Enugu State, Chimaroke Nnamani, has doubled down on his support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, daring his party, the Peoples Democratic Party to do its worst following his suspension for ‘anti-party activities’. Nnamani, who is seeking re-election for the Enugu East senatorial seat on the platform of the PDP, was suspended on January 20 along with others from other states by the leadership of the PDP for alleged anti-party activities. But, in a statement on Monday, Nnamani derided the PDP, describing his suspension “penkelemesi” (peculiar mess) that will collapse in no time. He said the suspension order was ill-conceived and unwarranted, saying that his right to a fair hearing was violated because he was neither informed of any complaints against him nor was he invited to the matter. Nnamani said: “My decision to pitch tent with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was necessitated by the PDP’s refusal to comply with its own constitution to wit; those key political offices should at all times be rotated between the South and North to guarantee harmony, peace, fairness, equity and justice.
 “As it is now, there is no fairness, justice and equity in the PDP because both the presidential candidate and the national chairman are from the same region. I am only exercising my right of freedom of choice and association. On this score, I stand with Tinubu.” Senator Nnamani urged the leadership of the PDP to put its house in order, insisting that his suspension by the party lacked both moral and constitutional backing.
