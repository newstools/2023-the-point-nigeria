BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Less than 24 hours after the African Democratic Congress collapsed its structure to support the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, BOOT party has also joined in the alliance. Announcing this in a ceremony held in Lagos on Tuesday, BOOT party adopted Peter Obi for president and adopted LP’s Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour as their governorship candidate in the state, while the state House of Assembly candidates will be harmonised. A delegation of the party’s national leadership met with the delegates of LP leadership, in a meeting chaired by the facilitator of the alliance, Afenifere leader, Ayo Adebanjo in his Lekki, Lagos home. The governorship candidate of Boot Party, Olawale Oluwo, said he had to shelve his ambition to support Obi to win Saturday’s presidential poll for the greater interest of Nigeria and Nigerians. Oluwo therefore urged residents of the state to come out en-masse to vote, assuring them of protection against intimidation or attack. Also speaking on the collaboration, Rhodes-Vivour, said the party will focus on empowering the residents of Lagos, adding that, “we want people to be productive and want the people to earn a living wage.” The party assured of their resolve to pull efforts and resources to deliver votes for Obi. Also present at the meeting were Mrs. Akerele Bucknor, former Deputy Governor of the state under Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
