The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu has invited all the party’s governors under the aegis of the Progressives Governors Forum to an emergency meeting on Sunday. APC national publicity secretary, Felix Morka, made this known in a terse statement on Friday night. No agenda was disclosed in the statement. It reads, “The National Chairman  of the All Progressives Congress (APC), His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, invites State Governors of the Party to an emergency meeting to be held on Sunday, February 19, 2023 by 2pm at the National Secretariat,  Abuja.” The meeting is coming on the heels of the Naira redesign crisis rocking the nation with the party’s top chieftains sharply divided over the right approach to sort out the lingering crisis.
