BY TIMOTHY AGBOR There was panic in strategic locations in Ibadan, capital of Oyo State after some angry residents trooped out and prevented vehicular movements in protest over scarcity of naira. Sporadic gunshots rented the air in some areas as security agents made efforts to disperse the protesters who took to the streets and kicked against the policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria to redesign the currency. A team of security agencies including soldiers, police, immigration, NSCDC and Correctional Services were stationed at the popular Iwo Road interchange and they shot sporadically into the air to prevent the irate protesters from disrupting vehicular movement as well as commercial activities in the city. Shops, offices and some commercial banks in the area hurriedly closed down their businesses as street traders and pedestrians scampered for safety. Recall that protest had been recorded in the early hours of Friday in Lagos before another protest scene was recorded in some parts of Ogun State. Meanwhile, the Ibadan protest commenced around 8am in some parts of the metropolis such as Iwo-Ibadan Road, Bode, Molete, Challenge and several parts of the ancient city. No life has been reported lost as normalcy has gradually been restored as of the time of this report. Meanwhile, hundreds of customers whose old N500 and N1,000 naira notes were rejected from their various commercial banks thronged the premises of the Ibadan branch of the CBN on Friday with the intention of depositing the old naira notes which have ceased to be legal tender. The customers, who have visited the apex bank as early as 7am complained that they were not being attended to as the gates leading to the premises were closed. Recall that CBN had ordered commercial banks to start attending to customers who want to return the old N1000 and N500 notes.
