Mobile money transaction value increased by 37.0 percent, to an annualised value of almost $100billion in Q3’23. Revenue in reported currency grew by 12.1 percent, to $3,914million with Q3’23 growth of 10.7 percent. Revenue growth in constant currency was 17.3 percent (18.0% in Q3’23) driven by double digit growth across all reporting segments. Mobile Services revenue in Nigeria grew by 20.9 percent, in East Africa by 11.9 percent and in Francophone Africa by 11.8 percent (and across the Group by 15.9 percent, with voice revenue growth of 12.7 percent and data revenue up 22.3 percent).

EPS before exceptional items was 10.8 cents, a reduction of 5.8 percent largely driven by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $184million.

EPS before exceptional items and excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses increased by 21.6 percent. “Capex increased 5.8 percent to $457million, in line with our guidance, as we continue to invest for future growth. Additionally, we acquired spectrum in Nigeria, DRC, Tanzania, Zambia and Kenya over the nine-month period,” Airtel explained.

The leverage ratio of 1.4x was slightly higher than the September 2022 level (1.3x), largely driven by the acquisition of spectrum in Nigeria. Segun Ogunsanya, chief executive officer, commenting on the performance, said: “Providing affordable, innovative and essential services to customers in our 14 markets with unparalleled network quality and customer service is integral to our ambition of transforming lives across Africa. These strong results are testament to this strategy despite the current macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties. The execution of our six-pillar strategy continues to provide the foundation for growth, driving 10% customer growth, supported by 14% growth in data customers and over 22% growth in mobile money customers. He noted that higher usage across voice, data and money, have contributed to further ARPU growth of over 7 percent, resulting in 18 percent revenue growth in the quarter as penetration across each segment continues to increase. I am particularly excited by the performance of our mobile money business, with annualized transaction value reaching nearly $100bn, as we continue to drive financial inclusion in the continent. Despite the inflationary pressures across our markets, the strong revenue performance in the first nine months of the year, combined with continued focus on cost optimisation, contributed to EBITDA growth of over 17 percent in constant currency, with stable EBITDA margins. Our strong operating performance, combined with continued focus on our capital allocation priorities has facilitated the de-risking of our balance sheet with the early repayment of $450m HoldCo debt in July this year. “We will continue to invest in expanding our network and evolving our service offerings to further deepen both financial and digital inclusion across our markets. We have especially focussed on enhancing our spectrum footprint across all our markets. Over the last nine months we have spent almost $490m on 4G and 5G spectrum across key markets to improve network capacity and quality, future-proof the company for continued growth opportunities and facilitate economic progress in all our markets,” he added.
