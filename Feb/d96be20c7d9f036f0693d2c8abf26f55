BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI The gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Ebonyi State, Francis Nwifuru, on Friday evening, narrowly escaped death, after a truck rammed into his convoy while returning from a campaign rally at Uburu community Ohaozara LGA of the state. The ghastly accident, which occurred at Amagu community located before timber shade axis of Abakaliki LGA, crushed the armoured car conveying the APC gubernatorial candidate beyond repair. Also involved in the accident were the state APC chairman, Stanley Okoro Emegha, the former Minister of Culture and Tourism, Frank Nchita Ogbuewu and the driver of the governorship candidate. The Director-General of the APC campaign organization, Austin Umahi, who is the younger brother of Governor David Umahi, told journalists shortly after the accident that the survival of Nwifuru was an act of God. According to him, “Yes, there was an accident but the act of God was mightily demonstrated, in the sense that we came on the divine mandate. This accident would have been avoided, but unfortunately, we don’t know whether the truck driver was drunk or not. “I personally narrowly escaped the accident and the next car was our gubernatorial candidate, Nwifuru. The truck driver just crossed the road and the next thing was to put them inside the bush. It is unfortunate but we thank God for everything because our candidate survived. “Both the driver and two other occupants, the state chairman of our party, Stanley Okoro Emegha and the former Minister of Culture and Tourism, Ambassador Frank Nchita Ogbuewu are in good condition,” he stated.
