Chief Magistrate Esther Idowu of Magistrate Court II, sitting in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, on Wednesday, remanded the suspected killers of Abeokuta couple, Kehinde and Bukola Fatinoye and their only surviving son, in prison for 60 days. The suspected killers, Adekanbi Lekan, Odetola Ahmed and Adeniyi Waheed were remanded in Oba correctional center, while their accomplices, Fadairo Temitope and Adekanbi Adenike, were remanded in Ibara Correctional Center. The suspected buyers of a vehicle stolen from the deceased compound, Owolaja Anuoluwapo and Usman Azeez, were also remanded in Oba prison for 60 days. They were brought before the court on an 11-count charge bordering on murder, conspiracy to commit felony, arson, stealing, escape from lawful authority, amongst others. The remand for 60 days in the first instance, according to the Chief Magistrate, was pending the legal advice of the Department of Public Prosecution. Although the accused persons were not allowed to take their pleas because of the nature of the case, an application for remand was however moved by Oluwatosin Jackson, applicantsâ€™ counsel.
