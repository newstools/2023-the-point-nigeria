Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has reiterated his warning that the state government will clamp down on banks and businesses rejecting the old naira notes. Explaining that part of the measures being considered may include getting security agencies to arrest anyone who refuses to accept old Naira notes, the Governor said the directive became imperative after an on-the-spot assessment of business transactions at some filling stations in Ijebu-Ode. In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, on Wednesday, the governor stated that old Naira notes of N1000, N500 and N200 are still valid and anyone who refuses to accept the old currency would be dealt with according to the dictates of the law. According to the Governor, “it has come to the notice of the State Government that some people and traders were rejecting the old Naira notes from the citizens, a development that is not healthy thereby inflicting untold hardship on the people of the State.” Governor Abiodun said the old Naira notes are still valid and anybody found rejecting them would be arrested and prosecuted, calling on the people to go about their legitimate businesses and report any person who refuses to accept the old Naira notes to the security agencies for necessary action. While urging the people not to take laws into their hands, Governor Abiodun directed those whose old notes are rejected to report erring business operators to the state government through the telephone numbers; 09099611266 and 08103341344.
