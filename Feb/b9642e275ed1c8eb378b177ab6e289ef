Ahead of the Saturday presidential and National Assembly elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission on Wednesday began the distribution of sensitive materials to the 18 local government areas in Cross River State. It started with the loading of BVAS machines into trucks at the INEC state headquarters in Calabar.
The sensitive materials were kept at the state branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria. The exercise was witnessed by the representatives of political parties and security officials. However, before the distribution of the materials, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof Gabriel Yomere, reiterated the instructions by security agencies that “no big man would be allowed to come out on election day with his orderly.” He said the issue of logistics had been taken care of, and that all was set for hitch-free polls. A representative of the state Commissioner of Police, ACP Kabiru Ibrahim, said adequate preparations have been made to provide security throughout the election period.
