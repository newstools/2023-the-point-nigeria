Three weeks ago Golden Eaglets-eligible winger Chinoso Chibueze put pen to paper on his first professional contract at Chelsea, without disclosing the length of the deal. Chelsea have confirmed as much, informing via their official website on Sunday that Chibueze has gone professional, agreeing a deal which keeps him at the club until at least the summer of 2025. Chibueze is one of the two wingers of Nigerian descent who have signed a professional contract with Chelsea in recent weeks, the other being England U17 international Tyrique George. Born in London, Chibueze will now continue his footballing education at Chelsea U18s under Nigerian manager Hassan Sulaiman, who has agreed to become the new coach of Chelsea U18s after making the step up from the U16s. The 17-year-old has played nonstop at Chelsea since the end of the U10 season after he was poached from west London rivals Fulham. Chibueze started and was in action for 59 minutes before making way for George as Chelsea suffered a 4-1 defeat at the hands of Arsenal in an U18 Premier League London derby at the weekend. Tudor Mendel-Idowu and Louis Flower both went the distance for the young Blues, while Arsenal starlet Ethan Nwaneri played the full game too.
