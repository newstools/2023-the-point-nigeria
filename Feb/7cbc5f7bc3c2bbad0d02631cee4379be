BY BRAEYI EKIYE A search through the Wikipedia platform describes politics as the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. I think this description aptly fits into Nigeriaâ€™s political experience over time, albeit negatively, as it relates to the vital and purposeful use of the utility value of leadership for the advancement of society. This is why the times call for enlightened, courageous, selfless and above all, patriotic leadership in the administration of the nation for the effective harnessing of her enormous human, mineral and material resources for real growth and development, such leadership that instantly evokes effective and even distribution of resources of the state and equitable allocation of sound and patriotic minds for appointive offices.
