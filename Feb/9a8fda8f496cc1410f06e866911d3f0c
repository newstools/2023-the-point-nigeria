Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, on Friday explained the rationale behind Federal Government’s decision to deploy a helicopter to the state saying it was “ to complement security measures already put in place in the state.” The Federal Government had deployed a helicopter to Ebonyi State to provide aerial surveillance during Saturday’s elections. The governor added that the helicopter would be flying at low altitudes and urged residents not to panic. He assured that the exercise was to deter insurgents or bandits from disrupting the election in any part of the state. “We got a surprise package from our security chiefs in Abuja aimed at having free, fair and credible elections in Ebonyi. The aircraft has already landed at our Ebonyi International Airport. “Its mission is to secure our lives and bolster the confidence of voters so that threats by bandits will not see the light of day,” he said.
