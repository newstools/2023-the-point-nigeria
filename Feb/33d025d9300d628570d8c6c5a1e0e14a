BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Independent National Electoral Commission in Osun State on Wednesday commenced the distribution of sensitive election materials to various local government areas in the state ahead of Saturday’s polls. The distribution which took place on the premises of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Osogbo Branch, was witnessed by the representatives of the parties, security agents, journalists and INEC officials. Before the distribution commenced, operatives of the Department of State Service, stationed at the entrance to the bank prevented journalists and other people that were to observe the distribution from entering the premises. The security operatives had claimed that the management of the CBN Osogbo branch had instructed that they should not allow anyone into the premises. However, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mutiu Agboke, insisted that journalists and party representatives should be allowed into the premises. Speaking after journalists had been allowed into the premises to witness the distribution, Agboke said the commission was ready for the poll. He said items such as ballot papers, result sheets would be taken to various local government areas. “Our sensitive materials, particularly, ballot papers, result sheets are usually in the custody of the Central Bank of Nigeria. We are ready for the election. We are here to start batching of our materials for onward transmission to these local government areas. “What you have seen on the ground are the ballot papers, result sheets for the presidential, senatorial, and House of Representatives elections. We will arrange and batch them to various local governments,” the REC explained. While assuring electorate and other stakeholders of the security of the materials and offices, Agboke said, “all these are indications that the Commission is ready. The commission is in touch with our security agents. The synergy is there. All our local government offices are well secured.”
