Ajax Amsterdam central defender Calvin Bassey has admitted that he was rejected by several English clubs before ending up at Leicester City on September 2, 2015 following a successful trial. Apart from failed trials at London clubs Crystal Palace, Leyton Orient and Charlton Athletic, Bassey said in a documentary aired on ESPN Nederland at the weekend that he was also at Southampton. Bassey spent five years at Leicester City before sealing a celebrated move to Rangers, with whom he won the Scottish Premiership in his maiden season with the club and reached the Europa League final in 2022. The versatile defenderâ€™s impressive performances in his final season at Rangers, especially in the Europa League, earned him a move one to one of the traditional clubs in Europe, Ajax Amsterdam.
