The National Council of State, on Friday, in Abuja backed the Central Bank of Nigeria’s naira redesign policy, but asked the CBN to print more notes or recirculate the old one to ease the suffering of Nigerians. The Council of State also reaffirmed that the general elections would hold as scheduled based on the​​ readiness of the Independent National Electoral Commission and the Nigeria Police. The Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the four-hour hybrid meeting at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. Also briefing newsmen after the meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State affirmed that though the naira redesign policy would still stand, the apex bank was advised to recirculate old notes if it could not print enough new notes and make them available to ease the economic tension.
