The Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun has commended the large turnout of voters at his polling unit. Abiodun who made this known during an interview with newsmen after his accreditation and voting for the Presidential and National Assembly Elections at Ward 3, Unit 2, Ita Osanyin in Iperu-Remo, Ikenne Local Government area of the state, disclosed that he expected the same level of commitment and turnout from voter’s across the 5,042 polling units across the state. Abiodun who had earlier exercised his franchise for the candidates of his choice during the Presidential and National Assembly elections, commended the people of the town and the state as a whole for coming out to exercise their franchise. “The voters turn out appears impressive and everything is going very well, one hopes that what we’ve seen here in my polling unit and a few other polling units I have seen this morning, one hopes that is what will be obtained in all the length and breadth of our 5,042 polling units across the state,” he said. Governor Abiodun while commending the Independent National Electoral Commission for a job well done, expressed his displeasure at the few identification cards made available for party agents in the state. “I want to thank the Independent National Electoral Commission for the hardwork they have put into the process, they’ve obviously taken on more responsibilities than they’ve done in the past, so one must definitely appreciate them for all they’ve done. “There were a few hitches early this morning which centered around the issue of agent identification tags, I am told that INEC did not provide enough cards for agents to identify themselves, am yet to confirm what caused that, I am not sure whether this applies to all parties, but our party agents have complained that they were short of quite a few agents card, but I believe that some arrangements have been worked out and voting has started,” he said.
