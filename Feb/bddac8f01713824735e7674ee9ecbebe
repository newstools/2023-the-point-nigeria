Nigerian-born midfielder and U23 invitee Tim Akinola has revealed that Arsenal have been monitoring his progress at Chesterfield. Akinola, who trained with Nigeria’s U23 national team in the fall of 2022 before an U23 AFCON qualifier against Tanzania, joined Chesterfield on a season-long loan last September. The 21-year-old was resigned to transferring to the fifth tier club on a temporary basis because he had just recovered from a serious ankle injury that he suffered during a loan spell at Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee United in the second half of last season. The Gunners have high hopes for the promising midfielder and extended his contract for two more years though he was sidelined by injury. Akinola has certainly enjoyed first team football at Chesterfield, with twenty two appearances in all competitions since his loan move. “They (Arsenal) watched the FA Cup and a couple of the league games,” Akinola told reporters.
