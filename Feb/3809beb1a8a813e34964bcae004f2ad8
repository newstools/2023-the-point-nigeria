Liverpool star Darwin Nunez could miss Reds Uefa Champions League (UCL) clash against European champions Real Madrid after sustaining a shoulder injury at the weekend. The Uruguayan forward gave the leader to the Reds inside 10 minute against Newcastle on Saturday afternoon in the Premier League (2-0 win). However, he had to be replaced by Roberto Firmino in the 59th minute after being injured in his shoulder. Speaking at post-match press conference, Jürgen Klopp said he doesn’t know whether it’s a serious injury or not. “The bad news is Darwin has something on his shoulder,” Klopp said with a tinge of regret. “We will see. In the end, he had to go off with a shoulder issue and we need further assessments. “I don’t know in the moment. In the moment, it’s painful. Hopefully it’s just painful and nothing more.” In addition, Liverpool is yet to provide an update on Darwin Nunez injury two days before their tie against Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid in UCL.
