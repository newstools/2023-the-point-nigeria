The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has written off the threat by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, and his group of G5 to order voters in their states not to vote for the party at the February 25 presidential election. Atiku argued that the days when a governor can dictate to voters on what to do were over. Atiku made this known in an interview with BBC Hausa service on Tuesday. Speaking in the Hausa language, Atiku said party crisis was not exclusive to the PDP. While expressing the hope of a resolution in no distant time, however, made it known that governors have little influence over voters now. “Each party has its internal crisis, we are still talking with them. Most are neither in PDP nor in other parties and definitely that will not make us lose the election because we are okay with the election preparations for now. “Election now is not like in the past when a governor will dictate who to vote for, election today is in the hands of the voters,” he added. He equally gave hint of his readiness to work with the candidates of the New Nigerian People Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso and Labour Party’s Peter Obi after meeting with the duo to support his ambition in the forthcoming election. He said both Obi and Kwankwaso are not so much of a threat to his chances of winning the poll. “Although, I see no threat in any of them but we are in talks, and the discussion might yield a positive result that will see one of them coming.” The PDP has been enmeshed in internal crisis since it conducted it’s presidential primary at which Atiku edged out Wike. The Rivers State Governor further lost political capital when Atiku overlooked him and settled for Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate. Meanwhile, there’s been suggestions that Kwankwaso could step down for Atiku, an allegation he has denied severally.
