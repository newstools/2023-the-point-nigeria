Following an outbreak of a major fire incident which has razed the popular Maiduguri Monday Market, President Muhammadu Buhari has called for vigilance as winds and rising temperatures increase the risks of fires in forests, homes, public buildings and markets. The President, who expressed grief over the destruction caused by the early morning fire on Sunday, said the nation’s prayers and condolences are with the hardworking traders and their families who have reportedly saved very little or nothing from the fire. President Buhari commended the immediate response of Governor Babagana Zulum’s government to the incident and directed effective coordination and collaboration between federal and state agencies to bring needed relief to those who are affected. The President urged the state and federal agencies responsible for fire management to strive towards higher levels of preparedness, mitigation efforts and strengthening their response mechanisms to deal with the increasing menace of market and other fire disasters.
