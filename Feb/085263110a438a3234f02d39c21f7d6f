BY MAYOWA SAMUEL With less than 16 days to the general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission has again assured that the Bimodal Voter Registration System cannot be manipulated. INEC Deputy Director of Information and Communications Technology, Lawrence Bayode, disclosed this on Wednesday while speaking on a live television programme. Previous elections in the country have witnessed ballot boxes usually being snatched by hoodlums during elections or gunmen to disrupt the voting process. However, Bayode disclosed that the BVAS will be deactivated from the backend so that whoever snatched the device on election day will not be able to manipulate votes. He said “If a BVAS is snatched, we have a system in place that can deactivate that particular BVAS. “We deactivate it so that whoever snatches the device will not be able to do anything with the device because the device pushes the accreditation data automatically on its own even without the operator pushing a button. When it is idle, it pushes that accreditation data to the backend.” Bayode said if hoodlums took the device to other places where they think they can manipulate the data on the device, the polling unit officer will report the incident. He said, “If such a thing happens, the Presiding Officer reports and from the backend, that device is deactivated so that the person who took away that device will not be able to do anything with the device.”
