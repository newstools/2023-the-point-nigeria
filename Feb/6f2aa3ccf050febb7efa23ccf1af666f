The National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, Iyorchia Ayu, has assured that he will not work against the senatorial ambition of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state. Ayu stated this while briefing newsmen at his Makurdi residence on Thursday. Ayu based his reason on the simple fact that “he ( Ortom ) is a candidate of the party.” The PDP will be going to tomorrow’s crucial election without a resolution of the crisis which had engulfed it following the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the party. Five governors led by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, insisted that Ayu should step down from his position as national chairman of the party to make for equity and fair representation, which he refused anyway. With the G5 unable to name a consensus presidential candidate, Ortom endorsed the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, for tomorrow. In fact he had long endorsed him as far back as January. Ortom is vying to represent Benue North-West senatorial district in the next senate on the platform of the PDP. Interestingly, the three senators representing Benue at the National Assembly, Gabriel Suswam, Emmanuel Oker-Jev and Abba Moro have all endorsed Atiku, distancing themselves from Ortom’s position to work for Obi.
