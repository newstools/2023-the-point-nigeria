The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission says the current review of remuneration for political, judicial and public servants in the country will be done objectively. This is according to a statement issued by RMAFC Public Relations Officer, Nwachukwu Christian, on Tuesday in Abuja. The PRO said that RMAFC Chairman, Mohammed Shehu, said this when he received members of the Nigerian Bar Association. Shehu said that the review would be concluded before the end of the present administration, stressing that it would be fair in carrying out its constitutional mandate. He said that RMAFC had demonstrated its commitment to the review by carrying out public hearings on the review in the six geo -political zones of the country simultaneously. He, however, attributed the delay of the review to poor funding, adding that the process of the current review would determine whether it would be upward or downwards. (NAN)
