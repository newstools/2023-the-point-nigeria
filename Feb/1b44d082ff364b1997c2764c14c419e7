The government of Ogun State has again been accused of mistreating the Yewa-Awori division of the state by allowing the polytechnic situated at Ipokia to rot away. The gubernatorial candidate of African Democratic Congress, Biyi Otegbeye, berated the incumbent Governor, Dapo Abiodun for preventing Ipokia Polytechnic from fully taking off, following its creation by the administration of Ibikunle Amosun. Spokesman for the ADC gubernatorial campaign, Raheem Ajayi, said in a statement that Abiodun had put a stop to the institution’s operation since the inception of his administration citing differences in the implementation of the policy surrounding the establishment of the polytechnic. Speaking at Ipokia on Friday in a rally to round off his two-day campaign to the Local Government, Otegbeye said, the complete neglect of the polytechnic is a further affront on the good people of Yewa-Awori. “What could be worse than preventing an effective take-off of the institution which would add immense value to the area? This is an orchestrated attempt to continue the aggravated underdevelopment of Yewa-Awori people and this is unacceptable. “The ADC administration under my watch would reverse this ugly trend. We will, in good faith, revisit the policy issues and revive the polytechnic.” Otegbeye stated that the economy of the area would have been turned around if Abiodun had not stopped the institution. “Besides the elevation of education standards of Ogun West district, the polytechnic is capable of creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs which would have added to the GDP of our dear state,” Otegbeye concluded.
