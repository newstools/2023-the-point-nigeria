BY TIMOTHY AGBOR THE Nigerian Bar Association, on Monday, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately direct compliance with the terms of the order by the Supreme Court in its judgement delivered on March 3, 2023 with regard to the Central Bank of Nigeria’s naira redesign policy. The NBA, in a statement by its President, Yakubu Maikyau (SAN), said it could not, under any guise or pretence, accept or tolerate any appearance of autocracy or dictatorship, insisting that the orders of the Supreme Court must be complied with. According to the association, the current situation is the greatest test or challenge to Nigeria’s constitutional democracy and the Executive cannot afford to disregard the orders of the Supreme Court made for the benefit of the people that elected it to power. The statement reads in part: “Nigerians may not be too enchanted with our Judiciary, and this may have arisen from unsubstantiated and spurious allegations of judicial misconduct, the fact however remains that we still must look to the Judiciary as the only and final resort, to protect our rights as a people and secure probity in public life. “The Supreme Court has spoken for the people of this nation and has appropriately issued orders to the Executive and the orders of the court must be complied with. “We cannot under any guise or pretence accept or tolerate any appearance of autocracy or dictatorship. “Our system of democratic governance has come to stay, it must not only be respected by all and sundry but must also be jealously guarded and protected. “This is the greatest test or challenge to our constitutional democracy and the Executive cannot afford to disregard the orders of the Supreme Court made for the benefit of the people that elected it to power.” “I therefore on behalf of all Nigerians, call on the President to immediately direct compliance with the terms of the orders made by the Supreme Court in its judgement delivered on 3 March 2023,” the NBA President said.
