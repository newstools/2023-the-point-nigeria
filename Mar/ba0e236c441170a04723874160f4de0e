BY TIMOTHY AGBOR Twelve-year-old student of Chrisland International School, Whitney Adeniran, who died during the school’s inter-house sports activities at Agege Stadium, Lagos State, has been laid to rest on Thursday. The school management had released a statement after her death that she slumped in “public view and not under any hidden circumstances.” However, Blessing, the mother of Whitney revealed in an Instagram live video on Wednesday that an autopsy carried out on her daughter revealed that she died of electrocution during the school’s sports activities. Bereaved family members and other mourners could not hold back tears during the burial. The Lagos State Government has said that the late Whitney Adeniran died from asphyxia and electrocution. This was disclosed in a statement from the office of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, on Thursday in Lagos. The statement revealed that the post-mortem report issued by the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on Wednesday showed that the deceased cause of death revealed asphyxia and electrocution. It added that the Directorate of Public Prosecutions had been instructed to issue legal advice on the matter with immediate effect. “The Lagos State Government commiserates with the deceased family while reassuring Lagosians that anybody found culpable would immediately be charged to court,” the statement read. Onigbanjo had on February 13 ordered a coroner’s inquest to ascertain the cause of death of the late Whitney, who died during the school’s inter-house sports on February 9.
