The Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba, has presented cheques of N16 million to families of police officers who died in active service in Kogi State. The IGP made the presentations through the Kogi State Commissioner of Police, Akeem Yusuf, who was represented by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Administration, DCP Abel Audu at the Command’s Headquarters in Lokoja. The N16 million cheques were presented to the next of kin of 28 Police Officers who died in active service in the state. Baba explained, “This gesture is part of the “Group Life Assurance Scheme” and IGP’s “Family welfare Insurance” aimed at improving the welfare of the families of the deceased Police Officers. “This is also aimed at encouraging other Officers who are in active service to give their best to the nation, which will not forget their patriotism and services. “To us as a force, the loss of the deceased personnel is tragic and painful but we all have to bear it as God knows why,” he said. He, however, urged the beneficiaries not to misuse the funds but should endeavour to make judicious use of them for the betterment of their families. Responding on behalf of the beneficiaries, Mrs S. John expressed appreciation to the IGP for the gesture and promised to make good use of the money for the benefit of their families. (NAN)
