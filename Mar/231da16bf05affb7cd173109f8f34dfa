The South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, is set to announce a reshuffle of the national executives on Monday, spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said on Sunday. Ramaphosa, who doubles as a businessman, is currently serving as the fifth democratically elected president of the country. The cabinet reshuffle has been widely expected since the president was re-elected leader of the ruling African National Congress at a party leadership contest in December, which paved the way for him to run for a second term in 2024. At a news briefing, Magwenya said, “The president is finalising his reconfiguration of the national executive and he is taking into account the swearing in of some members of parliament before announcing the reshuffle”. Ramaphosa is expected to name a new deputy president after the Presidency announced David Mabuza’s resignation from the post last Wednesday. The new position of electricity minister is among the roles to be filled. (REUTERS)
