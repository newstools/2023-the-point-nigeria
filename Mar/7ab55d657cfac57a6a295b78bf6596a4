The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, on Wednesday, disclosed that it has sacked two of its staff over what it described as “gross misconduct.” The board made the disclosure in a statement signed by its Head of Public Affairs and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin. The affected individuals who worked at the Benue office of the examination agency are Bilyaminu Ishaku and Andrew Candidus. According to the statement, their dismissal took effect from February 27, 2023. “Sequel to your appearance before the Senior Staff Disciplinary Committee and the subsequent recommendations of the committee, I am directed to convey to you the approval of the Honourable Minister of Education of your dismissal from the service of the Board from February 27, 2023, for serious misconduct,” the statement said. The board further noted that the dismissal was in line with the Public Service Rule 030401, which defined serious misconduct as a “specific act of very serious wrongdoing and improper behaviour, which is inimical to the image of the service and which can be investigated and if proven, may lead to dismissal.” “The staff were directed to submit their identity cards and all other property of the Board in their possession to the State Coordinator, JAMB Office, Benue State, for onward submission to the Director, Human Resources, with immediate effect,” it said.
