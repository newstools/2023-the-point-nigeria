Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro believes Victor Osimhen is good enough to play for European giants Real Madrid as well as top clubs in the English Premier League (EPL). Of the top five European leagues, the Nigeria national teamer has yet to feature in the English Premier League and La Liga, having previously worn the colours of Wolfsburg and Lille before a big-money move to Napoli in 2020. A transfer to the Premier League seems inevitable in the not too distant future amid speculation linking him with Manchester United and Chelsea, while the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United have been credited with an interest in the past. It has been claimed that Real Madrid are among a host of top European clubs eyeing a move for Osimhen, though their interest is not as advanced as some of their competitors such as United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. The number 9 has been outrageously good this season, scoring 21 goals in 26 matches before the visit of Atalanta, which has earned him plenty of admirers. Asked if Osimhen is aiming to play for teams like Real Madrid, Peseiro was quoted as saying by Italian journalists: “I’m sure: Victor will go to play for clubs like Real Madrid, he can reach those levels.” Osimhen recently stated that he aspires to play for a Premier League club, and reacting to the striker’s comments, Peseiro said he’s convinced that the 2015 U17 World Cup Golden Boot winner can play for a marquee club in Europe. “He can play for any top club in the world, whether it’s in the Premier League or elsewhere. “I don’t know if he’ll win the Ballon d’Or, but I’ll say this: he’ll certainly win the top scorer many times. Because he has an impressive scoring ability. “And not only that, the qualities that impress me about him are more and more,” Peseiro stressed. Peseiro was in attendance at the Diego Maradona Stadium for the Serie A clash between Napoli and Atalanta, and watched Napoli’s training session last Friday.
