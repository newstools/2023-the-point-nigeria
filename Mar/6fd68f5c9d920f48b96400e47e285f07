BY TIMOTHY AGBOR The presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has employed a legal team of 19 Senior Advocates of Nigeria to challenge the outcome of the February 25 election. While addressing the senior lawyers on Wednesday at his campaign Headquarters in Abuja, Atiku tasked them to reclaim his mandate at the court. He told the SANs to “establish the claim of illegality in the election and reclaim the mandate of the Nigerian people.” The team is headed by a seasoned litigation and commercial lawyer, JK Gadzama. Atiku further declared that it is crucial for them to go through this process not just for himself and PDP, but also to reinforce constitutional democracy and safeguard it for future generations. The list of SANs includes Chief Chris Uche, Paul Usoro, Tayo Jegede, Ken Mozia, Chief Mike Ozekhome, Mahmood Magaji, Joe Abraham, Chukwuma Umeh, Garba Tetengi and Chief Emeka Etiaba – as well as Chief Goddy Uche, Professor Maxwell Gidado; PDP’s National Legal Adviser A.K. Ajibade; O.M. Atoyebi; Nella Rabana; Paul Ogbole; Nuremi Jimoh and Abdul Ibrahim.
