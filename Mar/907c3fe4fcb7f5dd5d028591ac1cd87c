TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Governor of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke has approved the release and distribution of bond certificates worth millions of naira to retirees under the contributory pension scheme. This was conveyed in a statement by the Head of Service, Samuel Ayanleye Aina who said the beneficiaries cut across the entire gamut of the public service, namely primary schools, junior schools, secondary schools, tertiary institutions, civil service and the parastatals among others. According to the statement from the HOS, the presentation ceremony is billed to hold on Thursday at the Local Government Service Commission building. Aina stated that the presentation of the bond certificates is “a continuation of the commitment of the state government to workers’ welfare, in and out of service. “This is a new phase in fulfillment of Governor Adeleke’s open resolve to clear backlogs of salaries, pension and emoluments issues within the public service,” he said. It would be recalled that Governor Adeleke had commenced payment of inherited half salaries and other emoluments owed public servants by the past administration. The decision which is being implemented across the service had elicited widespread applause from within and outside the state.
