BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A 31-year-old woman, Rofiat Agbaje, has been remanded in Ilesa Correctional Centre in Osun State for allegedly defrauding one of the judges in the state. The Police in the state arrested Rofiat and arraigned her at an Osogbo Chief Magistrate’s Court for offences of fraud and theft. The defendant was accused of fraudulently obtaining the sum of N1.3million from one Justice Adegoke Lateef after promising to supply him some building materials which she failed to do. According to the police prosecutor, ASP Fagboyinbo Abiodun, the offence was committed on December 20, 2022, at about 4:00pm at Oke-Sapo Halleluyah area in Osogbo. The charge read, “That you Agbaje Rofiat and others, now at large, on December 20, 2022, at about 4:10pm, at Oke-Sapo Halleluyah area, Osogbo, in the Osogbo Magisterial District, did fraudulently obtain the sum of N1,300,000 (One Million Three Hundred Thousand Naira) from one Justice Adegoke Lateef, with intent of supplying him building materials, knowing full well to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 419 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Vol II, Laws of Osun, 2002. “That you and others, now at large, on the same date, time and place, did steal the sum of N1,300,000, property of one Hon. Justice Adegoke and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Vol II, Laws of Osun, 2002.” She entered into a not-guilty plea. The defence counsel, Najite Okobe, begged the court to admit his client on bail, saying the offence was bailable. However, the police prosecutor objected the bail application, asking the court to consider the amount involved.
Chief Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara ordered that Rofiat be remanded in the Nigerian Correctional Centre and adjourned the matter till March 20, 2023.
