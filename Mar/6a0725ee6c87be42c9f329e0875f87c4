As he prepares to leave office upon the conclusion of his two-term tenure, the Economic Community of West African States says it has made arrangements to honor President Muhammadu Buhari with an award in recognition of his achievements in the defence and promotion of democracy as a system of government throughout the subregion. The ECOWAS Chairman, Guinea Bissau’s Umaro Sissoco Embalo made the disclosure at a bilateral meeting with the President on the sidelines of the ongoing 5th United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries in Doha, Qatar. President Embalo said Buhari had done more than any other to support democratic governments in West Africa, just as he had done exceptionally well, waging battles against the emergence non-democratic regimes. For this, said the ECOWAS Chairman, President Buhari will have his name on the Roll of Honor in the community’s new headquarters building upon its completion in Abuja, so that future generations of West African citizens will know about the greatness he achieved and to copy his laudable examples. President Buhari welcomed the proposition, stressing that democracy is the best pathway to bringing together diverse people and a dependable vehicle for the achievement of national development.
