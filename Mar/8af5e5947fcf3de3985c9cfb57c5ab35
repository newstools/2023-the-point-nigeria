BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Ahead of the March 11 governorship election, the Labour Party in Rivers State has adopted the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, Siminialaye Fubara. The state Chairman of the Labour Party, Deinye Pepple, disclosed this at a news briefing in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, saying  Fubara’s senatorial district had yet to produce a governor since the creation of the state. Pepple noted that its decision was following uncertainties around its candidate in the state, Beatrice Itubo. He said, “Voting a riverine candidate in the person of Simimialayi Funara from the South East Senatorial District of the state during the up coming governorship poll ensures that the Labour Party and her members are defenders and ambassadors of the values that have set her Obidient movement apart from all other parties.”
