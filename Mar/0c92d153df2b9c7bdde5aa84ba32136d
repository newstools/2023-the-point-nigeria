Now we go there and sleep peacefully. There is a lot of food now. People from the neighboring countries even come to buy food in Nigeria,” he added. Another member of the community, Professor Akintunde Akinade, also thanked President Buhari for conducting an electoral process “alluded to as one of the best. We have gone through elections many times before and we all know what it’s all about. This is an election where money has taken a back seat. We’re very grateful to see what has happened this time in the presidential election. Thank you for bringing sanity to the country and the electoral process. We wish that this would continue.” He equally lauded the President for the infrastructural revolution in the country, his anti-corruption war, keeping Nigeria together as well as his well-known democratic crusade in Africa. “I really want to thank you for your unwavering critique of African Presidents that really want to stay in office forever. I wish you a well-deserved rest,” he added. The event was put together by the Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri Erewa.
