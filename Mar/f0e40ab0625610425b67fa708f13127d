Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has defeated Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State in the race for the Abia South Senatorial District. Abaribe who ran on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, beat the governor who belongs to the Peoples Democratic Party. The lawmaker was declared winner in Aba on Tuesday by the returning officer for the election Prof. Georgina Ugwuanyi. Abaribe polled a total of 49,693 votes to defeat his closest rivals and the candidate of the Labour Party Chinedu Onyeizu, who got 43,903 votes while Ikpeazu of the Peoples Democratic Party polled 28,422 votes. Enyinaya Abaribe, a former Senate Minority Leader, dumped the PDP in June 2022 and joined the APGA during plenary. Governor Ikpeazu is one of the G5 governors led by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike. They had insisted that they could not work for their party on account of the lopsidedness of the national officers of the party who are mainly from the North. Their request that National hairman, Iyorchia Ayu, should relinquish the position for a Southerner did not yield any result. Other members are Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State. They all lost their senatorial bid. The last member is Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State who is seeking reelection for a second term.
