Oluwaseun Osinbajo, the driver of the Lagos staff bus involved in last Thursday’s collision with a train that left six persons dead and several injured has begged victims for forgiveness. Passengers in the bus that survived the collision blamed the 44-year-old driver for the incident, alleging that he ignored warnings not to cross the train line before the incident. They said he had his earpiece on while driving and ignored the directive of the Flag Officers at the rail line. But Osinbajo blamed the incident on a mechanical fault in the bus. The driver, who works with the Lagos State Ministry of Transport, has been transferred to the State Criminal Intelligence Department after escaping the collision unhurt. He was heard telling his relations: “It was not my fault. How could I have ignored warning signs? The bus had a mechanical fault. “It is a pity this has happened. I beg everyone affected to please forgive me in the name of God,” he was quoted as begging.
