The House of Representatives has postponed its resumption date to March 21. This was made known through an announcement by the Clerk of the House, Yahaya Danzaria Esq. In a terse statement on Monday morning, Yahaya explained that the postponement became necessary to allow members of the House participate in the March 18 gubernatorial election coming up on Saturday. “This is to inform all Hon Members and the general public that the House of Representatives will resume plenary on Tuesday 21st March, 2023 at 11:00am as against the 14th of March earlier announced. “This change is intended to allow Members partake in the rescheduled Gubernatorial elections. All inconveniences are highly regretted,” the statement read. The Independent National Electoral Commission had announced a postponement of the election from March 11 to 18 because of the need to reconfigure the BVAS machine for the gubernatorial election.
