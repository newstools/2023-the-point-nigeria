BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Labour Party governorship candidate in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, has expressed sadness over the fire incident that engulfed the Akere Spare Parts Market on Kirikiri Road, Akere Bus Stop, Olodi-Apapa in Ajegunle on Wednesday morning. Rhodes-Vivour, in a tweet, via his Twitter handle, said it breaks his heart to see this happen in Lagos, adding that it must end. The LP Lagos governorship candidate, who visited the scene, also described the fire incident as most unfortunate. Rhodes-Vivour tweeted, “I am on the ground in Akere Market, Ifelodun, to assess the damage done by a fire allegedly set by an arsonist and political thugs. “This is most unfortunate. Our politics should be about ideas, not violence. “Ajegunle people, do not be intimidated. We will rebuild together. Lagos is built on harmony and cooperation, it is the centre of excellence, despicable violence and fanning the flames of ethnic tension has no place in this beautiful state. “We all have to live together in Lagos after the elections. No political ambition is worth the lives or livelihood of our people. “No place should be threatened or destroyed for having differing political choices. It breaks my heart to see this happen in Lagos, it must end.”
