BY TIMOTHY AGBOR No fewer than ten passengers have fared dead in a fatal accident that occurred at CBN bus stop, along the dilapidated Enugu-Onitsha expressway on Thursday morning. Lifeless bodies of some victims littered the scene of the crash while some passersby made frantic efforts to take both casualties and the survivors to nearby hospitals. The accident occurred at about 8:45am when an 18-seater bus with Enugu registration number, XL884 ENU ran into an incoming trailer carrying bags of cement. The bus was severely damaged as rescuers had to break its parts to remove victims. Eyewitnesses account revealed that the vehicle, which loaded from Abakpa, in Enugu East Local Government was headed to New Market when the accident occurred. “The driver whose name we learnt is Simeon was coming from Abakpa and made attempt to overtake another vehicle in his front that was emitting too much carbon monoxide. “As he made attempt to overtake the vehicle, the trailer was very close and the next thing we heard was a loud sound and the bus was completely damaged. I don’t know how many that survived but I counted over 8 dead bodies on the floor,” an eyewitness who gave his name as Chukwudi said. Others in the area attributed the crash to the poor state of the road which has forced many motorists to ply one-way. Personnel of the Nigeria Police, Army and Road Safety are already on ground to control traffic and avoid any breakdown of law.
