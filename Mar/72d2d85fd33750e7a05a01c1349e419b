Super Eagles midfielder, Frank Onyeka, made his long-awaited return from injury at the weekend as Brentford’s unbeaten run in the Premier League came to an end with a 1-0 loss to Everton at Goodison Park. Bees boss Thomas Frank brought on Onyeka in the 74th minute as a replacement for Christian Nörgaard. It was the midfielder’s first appearance for Brentford’s first team in 119 days as he had not played since November 12, 2022 when he helped the Londoners register 2-1 win at Manchester City. Onyeka was fit enough to return to the bench for the London derby against Fulham six days ago but was a non-playing substitute. He did not feature in ten games on the bounce while he was recovering from a hamstring injury. Onyeka’s return to action will be sweet music to the ears of Nigeria manager Jose Peseiro, who is set to announce his roster for the upcoming 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Burkina Faso this week. Peseiro has crucial decisions to make regarding his personnel in central midfield for the back-to-back matches this month. Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi and Southampton’s Joe Aribo are currently out of favour at their respective clubs, Lorient’s Innocent Bonke is still recovering from a heel injury and Onyeka is match-
rusty.
