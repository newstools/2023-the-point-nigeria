A Kano State Magistrates’ Court has remanded the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Doguwa, at a correctional facility over charges of culpable homicide and arson. Doguwa was taken before Court 58 of the Magistrate’s Court in the Nomansland area of the state metropolis Wednesday evening following his arrest at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport late Tuesday. The magistrate, Ibrahim Yola, ordered the remand of Doguwa after the First Information Report was read. He thereafter adjourned the matter to March 7. Earlier the Kano State Police Public Relations Officer, Superintendent of Police, Haruna Kiyawa, said Doguwa was arrested in connection with a suspected case of criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide, causing grievous hurt, mischief by fire and inciting disturbance. He said the arrest followed complaints “received on the gruesome murder of three persons, causing grievous injury to eight others in Tudun Wada LGA on 26/02/2023 while the collation of election results was ongoing and an alleged viral video of some victims with suspected gunshots in the Social Media.” Kiyawa said Doguwa was arrested because he refused to honour an invitation extended to him by the police. “He was subsequently arrested by detectives from the State Criminal Investigation Department Bompai Kano at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano,” the PPRO said.
