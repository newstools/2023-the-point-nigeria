The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed Muhammad Abachaâ€™s appeal, challenging the victory of Sadiq Aminu Wali, as Kano governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. The Kano division of the Court of Appeal on February 10, 2023, sacked Mohammed Abacha, as the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in the state. In its ruling, the court set aside the judgment of a High Court that recognized Abacha, as the PDP standard bearer in the state. The Supreme Court also ordered that Sadiq Wali, who was earlier recognized by the Independent National Electoral Commission, remained the valid governorship candidate. In a unanimous Judgement, on Wednesday, the Apex Court ruled that it is only the National Working Committee of a political party that is empowered to conduct primary elections and not the State Chapter. The apex court five-man panel, led by Justice John Iyang Okoro ruled that Sadiq Aminu Wali remains the authentic gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in Kano State, having been elected through a lawful primary election, conducted by the National Working Committee of the Party.
