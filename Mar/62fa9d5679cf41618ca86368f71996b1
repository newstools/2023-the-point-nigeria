Ganduje added that, “Tinubu’s decades-long fight for the restoration of democracy in the country, is well understood by Nigerians. Hence, we see wisdom and valid reason for entrusting our future to him.” While assuring that, the President-elect would evolve strategies in facing problems plaguing the nation, Governor Ganduje commended the APC leadership and membership “for standing firm to this point.” He also described Tinubu as “a master strategist, a builder of man and space, an acknowledged brilliant political leader, a leader with national spread, an enduring and ensuring promoter of sustainable democracy and development and a skillful mover.” Ganduje further said that “with our President-elect, Tinubu, leading the largest democracy in Africa, our continent will definitely benefit from his wealth of experience for the development of the continent. “Tinubu’s victory will not only benefit our motherland Nigeria, it will at the same time be a morale booster for Africa, as a continent and for the practice of global democracy,” the Governor added.
