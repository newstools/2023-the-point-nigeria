A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Robert Clark, says that if he were the lawyer of the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, he would advise him not to go to the Supreme Court because he would lose the case. Speaking during an interview on Arise Television, the elder statesman further stated that there is no election petition that has been won in Nigeria because the evidence available in court is enough for one to win any petition, he said. According to him, “I was not on the field during the election, so I am not aware of the allegations laid by those political parties. But, Doctor Abati, tell me how many election petitions have been won in Nigeria; you will see that there are none. “As you asked me before, if I were Atiku’s lawyer, I would advise him not to go to court because the evidence on the ground is not enough for him to win the election.”
