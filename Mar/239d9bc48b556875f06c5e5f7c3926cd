BY TIMOTHY AGBOR After being declared missing for five days, a 17-year-old boy, Elijah Akinrinlola, has been found dead on a tree. It was learnt that the deceased, who lived with his father at Bagbe, Ondo West Local Government Area of Ondo State, was found dangling on a tree at the neighbouring street by a search party. The Point gathered that the boy had at some times left home without returning that day. When he disappeared again recently, it was gathered that his parents thought it was his usual way of going away from home when he did not return home on the first day. A source said that a search party had been raised in the area to look for him but they couldn’t succeed after about three days. The boy was later found hanging on a tree with a rope around his neck after missing for about five days. The deceased was said to have been found on the tree by someone who was going to pick snails in the farm at night before he raised the alarm. One of his neighbours who craved anonymity said, “the family don’t know what could have led to this (mysterious death). I think he (Elijah) was a carpentry apprentice some time ago. “I don’t know if he was through with learning before this happened. He was a very lively person. He loved playing with people and having fun. This is shocking to me.” It was gathered that the police have invited some persons for questioning, including family members. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Ondo Police Command, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident, saying investigation had commenced.
