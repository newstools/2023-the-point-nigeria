The Lagos State Government has said it would divert traffic at the Old Tollgate bus stop down to the Berger section of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway for 10 weeks. The traffic diversion would commence from Monday, January 30, 2023, till Friday, April 15, 2023, the state’s Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, said in a statement. The government said the diversion was due to the continuation of the ongoing rehabilitation of the road by the Federal Ministry of Works. The statement further hinted that, in the notification received by the state’s Ministry of Transportation, it was stated that the construction would be carried out in short segments in order to minimise inconveniences for motorists. Also, traffic on the Ibadan-bound carriageway would be narrowed to two lanes to allow for the reconstruction of the other half of the road. Oladeinde further stated that the U-turn in front of the Lagos State Emergency Centre would be temporarily closed to traffic, adding that motorists on the expressway would be diverted to the next U-turn at the Old Toll Gate by the traffic control point. Besides, Oladeinde emphasized that the traffic from CMD Road, intending to connect 7UP and Motorways on the Lagos-bound carriageway would also make use of the Old Tollgate/Traffic Point U–turn. He equally stressed that trucks and heavy-duty vehicles would be diverted to Ojota Interchange, while the traffic on CMD Road inbound the expressway would be redirected to the entry point beside the FMW weighbridge to access the expressway on a contraflow. The commissioner further appealed to the citizenry to shun indiscriminate stopping, waiting and parking along CMD Road, maintaining that this would complement the efforts of the traffic management team that would be deployed to manage vehicular movement. Oladeinde assured that signage with directions would be mounted along the road to guide motorists.
