The appeals filed by the Ogun state chapter of the African Democratic Congress against the judgments of the Federal High Court of Abeokuta, Ogun state have been slated for hearing on Wednesday, January 11, 2023. The petitions will be determined at the Court of Appeal in Ibadan, Oyo State. The Federal High Court Abeokuta had earlier ruled that the candidates of the ADC in Ogun state were not properly nominated and thereby directed the Independent National Electoral Commission to delist the governorship and House of assembly candidates from its portal. The cases were instituted by members of the Labour Party and the All Progressive Congress in Ogun State. The ADC and its candidates promptly approached the Court of Appeal Ibadan for the reversal of the Abeokuta Federal High Court judgements.
