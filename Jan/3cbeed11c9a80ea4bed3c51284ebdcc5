BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke has applauded the contributions of members of Nigeria’s Armed Forces to the peace and stability of Nigeria. He admonished Nigerians to appreciate the efforts of the military in stabilising the nation, adding that Nigerian fallen heroes paid the supreme sacrifice to the peace the country is enjoying. Governor Adeleke maintained that the stability of the nation rested on the gallantry, patriotism and sacrifice of the security and military services. Addressing serving and retired members of the armed forces at the launching of Emblem for the 2023 Armed Forces Remembrance Day in Osogbo, Osun state capital, on Thursday, the governor stated that service personnel of the armed forces in particular were in many volatile sectors of the society confronting and curtailing open and subtle threats to the territorial integrity of the country. He said, “That we must live, many offered their precious lives. We must therefore continue to acknowledge the contributions of the armed forces to the survival of the nation. “As we gathered here today, I reassure the military service of the commitment of our government to expand the present level of partnership. Our administration has a security sector reform which places welfare of service personnel at the centre stage. “Today, I recommit to the well being of our service personnel. Our veterans and their families will continue to receive our support in recognition of their service to the fatherland. “It is on this note that I launch the appeal fund for the 2023 Emblem for the Armed Forces Remembrance Day with a sum of Five Million Naira.”
