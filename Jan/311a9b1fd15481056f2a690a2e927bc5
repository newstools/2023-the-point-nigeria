Lassa fever is an animal-borne, acute viral illness spread by the common African rat (Mastomys). It is endemic in parts of West Africa including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. About 100,000 to 300,000 infections of Lassa fever occur annually, with about 5,000 deaths. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been used with success in Lassa fever patients. It has been shown to be most effective when given early in the course of the illness. According to NCDC, a suspected case is any individual presenting with one or more of malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss and either a history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents , or contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms or any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia. The health agency stated that a confirmed case is any suspected case with laboratory confirmation, while a probable case is any suspected case that died or absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing. The primary transmission of the Lassa virus from its host to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with the vector.
