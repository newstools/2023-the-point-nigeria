BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Three residents of a village in Iwo, Osun State, were said to have been kidnapped by some gunmen. The gun-wielding men were said to have invaded the Iwo local community and took three persons away. The police said the kidnap victims are Hamzat Ibrahim, Deere Ibrahim and a 38-year-old man, whose name was yet to be identified. The victims and other neighbours in the settlement were said to have screamed in order to call the attention of other villagers to the attack. The incident happened at about 10pm on Friday, according to sources. It was gathered that the attackers shot sporadically to scare the people away before kidnapping the three persons. The development threw the villagers into panic as others ran to the nearest police station to raise the alarm. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Yemisi Opalola confirmed the abduction and said efforts were on to rescue the victims. Opalola said one Hamidat Ibraheem reported the case. She said police officers, hunters and other local security agencies were combing the forest to rescue the victims.
