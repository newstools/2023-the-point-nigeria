The Department of State Services has reacted to reports that its personnel invaded the headquarters of the Central Bank of Nigeria in Abuja on Monday. Spokesperson for the DSS, Peter Afunanya, debunking the report in a short statement, said,
“The attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) has been drawn to the false news making the round that its operatives invaded the Central Bank of Nigeria and arrested its Governor, today 16/1/23. This is fake news and quite misleading.” There had been unverified reports, not by THE POINT, that operatives of the DSS invaded the CBN headquarters and took over the office of the Governor of the apex bank, Godwin Emefiele. Recall that Emefiele had reportedly been out of the country on leave, and had told the National Assembly that he was indisposed and could not appear at a hearing he was supposed to attend. The DSS had reportedly also sought a court order to arrest the CBN governor over alleged terrorism financing.
