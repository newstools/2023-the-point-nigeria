The Supreme Court has restored former Akwa Ibom State Governor, Godswill Akpabio, as the senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Akwa Ibom North Senatorial District. The Court of Appeal in a judgment delivered on November 14, 2022, voided his candidacy but it was overturned by the apex court.

Justice Saulawa after reviewing the arguments canvassed by Akpabio said that his appeal was meritorious and allowed. Details laterâ€¦.
