With the high costs of diesel, fuel and epileptic electricity supply, it has become extremely difficult to run a business profitably in Nigeria. Energy cost is taking a huge chunk of the operating capital of manufacturers rising over 40 percent in some cases. In a recent statement, the Kwara/Kogi branch of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said with the skyrocketing price of diesel, it has become almost impossible for them to operate. The branch Chairman, Bioku Rahmon in the statement said the manufacturing sector was facing huge energy crisis with non-existent public power supply and high cost of diesel. He appealed to the Federal Government to urgently come to the aid of the manufacturing industry.
