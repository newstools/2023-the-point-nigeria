Tesla (TSLA.O) has said that the electric vehicle maker, which cut prices of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles in the U.S. and Europe overnight, was able to provide its cars at a more accessible price because cost inflation was normalising. “At the end of a turbulent year with interruptions to the supply chain, we have achieved a partial normalisation of cost inflation, which gives us the confidence to pass this relief onto our customers,” a spokesperson for Tesla Germany said in a statement at the weekend.
