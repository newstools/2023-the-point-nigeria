Train service along the Abuja-Kaduna corridor has been suspended indefinitely following the derailment of the train at Kubwa in Abuja on Friday. The Abuja-bound train derailed with no casualty or fatality recorded. An official of the NRC at the Kubwa train station who pleaded anonymity said that the incident occurred at about 3:15 pm which coincided with the arrival of the afternoon train. This incident came barely a week after train service along the Warri-Itakpe corridor was also suspended due to derailment. Explaining how the incident occurred, he said: “The derailment occurred close to the station. There were no casualties and all of them (passengers) were successfully disembarked. “At the moment when the train approached a point where it was supposed to take a turn, it derailed from the rail line.” The Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation, Fidet Okhiria also confirmed the incident. He, however, said the reasons for the derailment were unknown at the moment. He said: “It is true that the train derailed today (Friday) but the good news is that no life was lost. On the suspension of operations, he said: “Currently trains cannot pass because of the derailment. So, train service has been suspended for now but if our men can work overnight, then we might resume service tomorrow.” The Point recalls that train service along the corridor resumed operation on December 5, 2022 after it was suspended for over eight months due to an attack on the tracks on March 28, 2022. The attack which led to the death of eight people saw several people injured and over 60 kidnapped. Train operations resumed in December after those who were kidnapped regained freedom.
