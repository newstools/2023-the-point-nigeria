The Federal Road Safety Commission has approved the promotion of an Assistant Corps Marshal to the rank of Deputy Corps Marshal and seven others to ACM. The approval came at the end of the meeting of the commission’s Board, which ratified the resolution of the FRSC Establishment Committee on the promotion. This is contained in a statement by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, on Friday in Abuja. Kazeem said that the officer promoted to the rank of DCM, Ann Marja, was to represent the North East following the appointment of the former DCM representing the Zone, Dauda-Ali Biu as substantive Corps Marshal. He said that those promoted to the rank of ACM were Stella Uchegbu, who is in charge of Special Duties; Tukur Sifawa, the Corps Auditor; and Anthony Oko, in charge of Command and Strategy in the Operation Department. Others are Mohammed Kabo, the Sector Commander in Yobe; Joel Dagwa, Deputy Commandant, FRSC Command and Staff College; Meshack Jatau presently on course at Army War College and Pauline Olaye, in charge of Pension and Insurance.
The Board Chairman, Bukhari Bello, expressed happiness over the transparency and objectivity displayed during the whole process.
Bello urged the promoted officers to show more commitment and rededicate themselves to achieving the corporate mission of the Corps. The chairman said that the promotion was part of the commission’s drive toward rewarding excellence, diligence and hard work. The Corps Marshal, Dauda Biu, also congratulated the newly elevated officers for their excellent performances, adding that every promotion comes with greater responsibilities. Biu, therefore, urged them to put in their best in the course of their duties as the new ranks called for more focus, dedication, commitment and passion. He promised to improve the general welfare of the personnel of the Corps to the satisfaction of all. NAN
