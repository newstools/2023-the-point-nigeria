BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Bauchi Emirate Council has approved the removal of Muhammadu Bello Kirfi as the Wazirin Bauchi, over alleged “disloyalty and disrespect” to the State Governor, Bala Mohammed. The removal was conveyed in a letter signed by the Secretary of the Bauchi Emirate Council, Shehu Mudi Muhammad. Kirfi, a retired federal civil servant, was a Minister in the government of Shehu Shagari in the 1980s, the Pro-Chancellor, University of Ilorin from 1997-99 and was Minister of Special Duties during the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo in the 2000s.

He said, “I am directed to refer to a letter received from the Ministry of Local Government Affairs of reference No: MLG/LG/S/72/T dated 30th December 2022.” “The content of the said letter indicated your disloyalty and disrespect to the Executive Governor of the State and the government.
