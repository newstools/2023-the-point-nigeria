In line with his mandate on training and human capacity development, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has commenced two-week fully residential refresher training for all 79 Squadron Commanders of the Nigeria Police Mobile Force. This is taking place at the Police Mobile Force Training College, Ila-Orangun, Osun State from January 9 to 23, 2023. According to a statement on Friday by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the training programme is geared at strengthening the operational efficiency of the Squadron Commanders and for more effective tactical deployment of their personnel to ensure a secured and hitch-free environment before, during, and after the 2023 general elections to generally reduce crimes to their barest minimum in Nigeria. Adejobi explained that some of the focus of the course includes the use of contemporary riot control gadgets for suppression of riots and other serious disturbances, crowd control techniques, ambush and counter-ambush, diplomatic protection, combating internal security challenges and insurgency as well as gun safety and weapons handling. He said that the IGP has charged officers and men of the Police Mobile Force, the punching arm of the Force, to effectively make use of the opportunities the training would offer them and improve on their crime control mechanisms and general safety strategies, especially towards having free, fair and credible 2023 general elections. In the same vein, the FPRO said that the IGP on Thursday met with representatives of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs to discuss possible areas of partnership to strengthen the oversight and accountability mechanisms of the Nigeria Police Force including the Complaint Response Unit and the Provost Department of the Force.
