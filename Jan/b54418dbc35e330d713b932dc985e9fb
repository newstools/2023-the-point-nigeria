BY FESTUS OKOROMADU For the first time in 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari had a meeting with the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, on Thursday at the Aso Rock presidential villa. The private meeting came on the heels of Emefieleâ€™s resumption of office on Monday after his return from his annual vacation. Prior to the private meeting, Emefiele had earlier led a delegation from the Arab Bank for Economic Development to the seat of power. The closed-door meeting which lasted for about 25 minutes was the first between both men this year. However, the CBN governor refused to speak to journalists on the issues discussed at the meeting. There had been speculations on an alleged rift between the CBN Governor and the Federal Government as attempts were allegedly made to arrest the apex bank governor over allegations of terrorism by the Department of State Security. Emefiele was also scheduled to hold a meeting with the 36 state governors on Thursday over the new Naira noted policy implementation.
