A high court sitting in Akure, Ondo State capital, has nullified the impeachment of the former deputy speaker of the state House of Assembly, lroju Ogundeji. The court also ordered his immediate reinstatement as the assemblyâ€™s deputy speaker. More so, Samuel Aderoboye, who is presently the deputy speaker, has been ordered to stop parading himself as the deputy speaker. Ogundeji was impeached last year by the members of the assembly who accused him of gross misconduct. They held that by his conduct he had brought the assembly to disrepute. Ogundeji was immediately replaced by Samuel Aderoboye from Odigbo as the deputy speaker. Dissatisfied with the resolution of the house, Ogundeji, who represents Odigbo Constituency 2, approached the court to nullify his impeachment.
