The Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has appeared before the Ad Hoc Committee of the House of Representatives looking into the new Naira notes. Emefiele appeared before the committee on Tuesday after days of grandstanding between him and the House. Last week, the committee was left fuming after Emefiele shunned invitations of the House despite the threats of arrest warrants by the lawmakers. On Thursday, the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, Alhassan Doguwa (APC, Kano), said the committee was giving Emefiele the last chance to appear or risks arrest. However, on Sunday, the CBN governor announced the extension of the deadline by 10 days to February 10, 2023.
