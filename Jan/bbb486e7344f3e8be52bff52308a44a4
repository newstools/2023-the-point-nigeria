The Court of Appeal sitting in Sokoto State has reinstated the People’s Democratic Party governorship candidate, Dauda Lawal, as the candidate representing the party in the 2023 governorship election in Zamfara State. The judgment has set aside the ruling of the Federal High Court sitting in Gusau, the state capital, which had earlier disqualified Lawal in November 2022 The PDP governorship candidate had urged members of the party, supporters, and the public to remain calm following the nullification of the PDP governorship primary that produced him as the candidate of the party in Zamfara State for the second time. A statement by Lawal’s media office further said the judgment by the Federal High Court, Gusau was a distraction strategy at play, noting that Lawal’s legal team would challenge the decision at the Appeal Court and had expressed confidence that the decision would be set aside. The Federal High Court had ruled that the PDP had no candidate for the said position in the forthcoming election in the state. However, the judgement of the Appeal Court on Friday readmits Lawal into the race to contest for the seat of governor of Zamfara State.
