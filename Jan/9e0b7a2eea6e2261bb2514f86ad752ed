BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on Wednesday in Kano, took potshots at the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, saying he has nothing to offer after being part of the PDP administration that plundered Nigeria’s wealth when he was vice president. Tinubu, as he continued his nationwide campaign rally in Kano, said the River State Governor, Nyesom Wike, was right after all, when he declared that Atiku had no integrity. While urging the people of the state to vote for him in next month’s presidential poll, he warned them not to be deceived into allowing the PDP return to power under any guise as, according to him, it would be a return to maladministration in all areas. The former Lagos State governor also accused Atiku of establishing a university too expensive for Nigerians to attend while in office as Vice President. Tinubu, who had been in Kano since Monday, meeting with Muslim leaders from the North-West in a town hall meeting, said he has what it takes to continue “the developmental strides started by President Muhammadu Buhari after the 16 inglorious years of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in power”. A mammoth crowd of supporters had thronged the Sani Abacha Stadium, venue of the rally with the party’s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Vice Presidential Candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima, Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, and Chairman, Progressives Governors’ Forum and Governor of Kebbi, Senator Atiku Bagudu, in attendance.
