A 35-year-old father, Temitayo Bamiro, was docked at an Ojo Magistrateâ€™s Court, Lagos on Monday for allegedly defiling his 13-year-old daughter. Bamiro pleaded not guilty to the one-count charge preferred against him. The prosecutor, Simon Uche, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on January 7, at the Iba New Site in Ojo, Lagos. He said Bamiro was in the habit of sexually assaulting his daughter and had forcefully penetrated her anus repeatedly in the past without her consent. The offence, he added, contravened the Criminal Laws of Lagos State. The presiding magistrate, L.J.K Layeni, referred the case file to the Directorate of Public Prosecution for legal advice and adjourned the case to February 22 for mention. He also ordered the remand of Bamiro at the Badagry Custodial Centre. (NAN)
