BY BAMIDELE FAMOOFO In the second half of December, banksâ€™ opening position averaged N411.21bn, a 2,173 percent increase from the average position of N18.09 billion in the same period in November. This was partly due to FAAC disbursements of N902.10 billion in December, which was a 22 percent increase from the sum of N736.78 billion disbursed in November.
