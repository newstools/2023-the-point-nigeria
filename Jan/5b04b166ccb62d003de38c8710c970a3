BY TIMOTHY AGBOR A Sharia Court in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State on Tuesday dissolved the three months old marriage between a couple, Muhammad Abdulganiyu and Ma’arufat Ibrahim. The wife, Ibrahim, was said to have packed out of her husband’s house after alleging the latter of failing to provide food for her. Delivering his judgement, the Judge, Malam Rilwan Kyaudai said the marriage was dissolved after all efforts to reconcile the couple by the court and their guardians failed. He ordered the woman (Ibrahim) to return N20,000 paid as dowry. “She will also return the marriage suitcases she received and contents with the exception of the ones she has also sown. ”She will not return the cell phone as requested by the complainant but she will return the silver rings she received from him,” he held. Earlier, Abdulganiyu in his petition alleged that his wife left their matrimonial home without any altercation. “I tried my best to provide for her, but she and her mother do not appreciate my efforts and we’ve been married barely three months. ”If she’s not interested in the marriage anymore, she should pay me all I spent during the wedding and return the phone and silver rings I gave her”, he said. But, the wife said she left because her husband did not provide food for her. She said that he had told her that his mother pushed him into marrying her.
