A Nigerian professor based in the United States, Marinus Iwuchukwu, and a woman identified as Charce Dunn have been found dead in Pittsburg Pennsylvania. They were found dead along Thorncrest Drive, Wilkins Township, Pittsburg on Tuesday after an alleged “domestic disturbance” around 10 am. The Allegheny County Police said they received a call to check on the well-being of a couple inside their home. According to the police, a third party was unable to reach the male resident and learned that the man had been stabbed. A woman remained inside the residence with a firearm. The SWAT team made entry into the home and found a 59-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman dead, Pittsburgh’s Action News 4 reports. Both appeared to have sustained lacerations, and the woman sustained an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. The police said the incident is being investigated as a suspected murder-suicide. Reacting to the development, Duquesne Catholic University, where Iwuchukwu worked as an associate professor of theology until his death, commiserated with family and friends of the late don. “This is a tragedy for all involved and our thoughts and prayers are with Professor Iwuchukwu’s colleagues, students, friends, and loved ones,” the varsity spokesman Gabriel Welsch said in a statement.
