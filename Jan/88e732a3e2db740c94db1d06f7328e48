Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has mocked former vice president and Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, over former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s endorsement of Labour Party’s Peter Obi. Atiku was vice president during the Obasanjo administration between 1999-2007. Obasanjo, however, on Sunday endorsed Obi for the country’s number one seat next year, overlooking Atiku and other candidates. The development prompted Wike to declare  “there is something fundamentally wrong”. Speaking on Monday at the flag-off of the construction of Akpabu-Odido Road in Emohua and Ahoada West local government areas of the state, Wike said he was praying that Obasanjo should not say anything. He confessed that when he saw the letter, he was touched. “I was praying that Obasanjo should not say anything. When I saw the letter last night, I was touched. If your principal cannot recommend you, then there is something fundamentally wrong.” Wike narrated how spokespersons of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council has been telling stories of how he influenced Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State to throw the contest open, insisting that it was a lie. He argued that he canvassed the zoning of the national chairmanship of the party to the North so that the South can produce the next president. He added that it was in that same spirit that he attended the three meetings of the Southern Governors Forum where they agreed at Asaba, Lagos and Enugu that the presidency should come to the South.
