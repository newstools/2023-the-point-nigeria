BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has said the various ethnic agitations across Nigeria are products of failed leadership. Fielding questions during his address at Chatham House, London, Obi said equity, justice and fairness would solve the problem of agitations in the country. Asked by a member of the audience at the event about his alleged refusal to condemn the activities of members of the secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, Obi said, “There are agitations across the country. There is agitation for Biafra and the Yoruba Nation.” He maintained that poverty in the country as well as failure of leadership led to the various ethnic agitations in the country. He condemned the various agitations but said he would go into dialogue with the agitators.
