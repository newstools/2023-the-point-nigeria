BY BRIGHT JACOB The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has dragged President Muhammadu Buhari to court over electricity tariff hike. This was confirmed in a statement on Sunday by the group’s Deputy Director, Kolawale Oluwadare. Joined in the suit as respondents are the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading PLC. The group’s action comes after NERC approval to Electricity Distribution Companies to increase tariffs. The case, with suit number FHC/L/CS/99/2023 was filed last Friday at the Federal High Court, Lagos. SERAP told the court to “compel President Buhari to direct the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, and appropriate anti-corruption agencies to promptly investigate the spending of public funds as investments and bailouts to DisCos and GenCos since 2005.”
