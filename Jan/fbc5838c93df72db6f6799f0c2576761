The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Kaduna State Command says its operatives have arrested four suspects with 298 bags of Cannabis Sativa. NDLEA’s Commander in the state, Ibrahim Braji stated this at a news conference in Kaduna on Wednesday. He said that operatives of the agency arrested the suspects in the evening of January 3, at Tasu Mahuta community on Refinery Road, Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The Commander said the operatives apprehended the suspects comprising two females and two males in possession of cannabis weighing 3,576kg. The matter, he said, is being investigated to unravel other suspects for arrest and prosecution, adding that the command had expended its operational structure in the state to curtail the influx and outflow of drug. He listed the new area commands to include Makarfi, Soba, Kaduna North and Kaduna South, adding that patrol vehicles had been deployed to Samaru, Zaria and Sanga area commands due to its proximity with many states. Braji further said that as the 2023 general election was approaching, the command would carry out enlightenment campaign to sensitise the youth to dangers of drug abuse and its negative impacts. “The sensitisation will be at schools, religious bodies, traditional institution and vulnerable places,” he said, and urged the youths not to allow themselves be hoodwinked by bad elements as tools of destruction to the society.
