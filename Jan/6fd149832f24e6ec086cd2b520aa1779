The Supreme Court on Friday nullified the primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party which produced Jones Onyereri as its Senatorial candidate for Imo West in the February 25, National Assembly election. Justice Emmanuel Agim in a judgment on the appeal filed by Nnamdi Ezeani, ruled that the PDP violated section 87 (9) of the Electoral Act by conducting the primary election outside the venue stipulated by law. The apex court, therefore, nullified the primary election on the ground that it was conducted in Owerri, the Imo State capital, instead of Orlu being the senatorial headquarters of Imo West.
It held that by the judgment, PDP will not participate in next monthâ€™s senatorial election having failed to produce its candidate within the time allowed by law. It also held that since the time for the conduct of primary election to nominate candidates was already over, it is deemed that the party would not have a candidate in the February 25, National Assembly poll. Justice Agim warned parties to always conduct their affairs within the ambit of the law adding that section 87 (9) of the Electoral Act is clear on where a primary election should be conducted.
