The Founder of Household of God Church and former presidential candidate, Chris Okotie, has warned that Nigeria’s survival depends on its restructuring. According to Okotie’s New Year message released by his media adviser, Ladi Ayodeji, the cleric said Nigeria would need strong governance structures and a stable polity if it would overcome the 2023 global economic crisis predicted by experts. “In continuation of his interim government campaign which he began in 2019, Okotie said that for Nigeria to overcome the 2023 global economic headwinds predicted by experts, the country would need strong governance structures and a stable polity which are absent in the present constitution,” the statement read, adding that, “unless his Aboriginal Democracy proposition is adopted, the country could flounder under a severe socio-political and economic crisis.” The interim government campaigner noted that, given the fact that 80 per cent of Nigeria’s income is used to service its current debt of N77 trillion, against a backdrop of a bloated bureaucracy, the country has no choice under the current constitution than to keep borrowing to run the country. He said, “In the light of this reality, a new constitution is required to deal with all the existential problems in all spheres of our national life, which is why Aboriginal Democracy is recommended.” According to the statement, Okotie expressed concern that the International Monetary Fund has warned that one-third of the world, including Nigeria, would be in recession this year. He urged his congregation at his church to pray for the peace and prosperity of Nigeria. “Every member of this church should continue to set aside a few hours to pray for Nigeria because the Household of God was set up to play a pivotal role in the destiny of this country, that’s why I am involved in the political process,” he said.
