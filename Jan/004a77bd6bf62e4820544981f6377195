The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has warned vandals to desist from the nefarious act of vandalising public infrastructure. Olusola Odumosu, NSCDC Director Public Relations told the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday in Abuja that the Corps had put in place measures to deal with culprits. The director said it was worrisome that vandals have targeted pipelines, rail lines, manhole covers and bridges in their continued sabotage of national assets. “Vandalism of bridges constitutes great risks and dangers to the lives of users as they could fall to their untimely deaths unknowingly. “A bridge could also collapse once it becomes weakened by the destruction of its various parts which makes it structurally deficient at some points. “The Federal Government is investing heavily in infrastructural development in the country and has provided bridges amongst other public utilities to ensure safe mode of movement for citizens,” he said. The director reiterated that NSCDC would intensify monitoring of all infrastructure and arrest of vandals across the country. He enjoined citizens to join hands with security agencies in ensuring adequate protection and safety of lives and public infrastructure. Odumosu said Nigerians should give useful and prompt information to the Corps and other security agencies to ensure proper protection of public assets. (NAN)
