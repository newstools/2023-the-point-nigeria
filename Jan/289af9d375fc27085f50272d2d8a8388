Super Eagles striker Emmanuel Dennis is being linked with a return to Watford in the January transfer window. According to reports, Nottingham Forest have been presented with a potential opportunity to sign Watford winger Ismaila Sarr in a possible deal that could see Dennis head the other way. Sarr was a key player for the Teranga Lions of Senegal in the 2022 World Cup, starting all their games in Qatar and was on the scoresheet in a 2-1 win over Ecuador in the group stage. Dennis has been put on the transfer market by Nottingham Forest after a drop in form following his move to the City Ground last summer, scoring one goal in thirteen appearances across all competitions. Forest’s 4-1 loss to Blackpool was only the fourth start made by the Nigeria international for the Reds. Fifa’s rules forbid a player from appearing for three different clubs in a single season, meaning Dennis’ potential return to Vicarage Road looks the most realistic option for the 25-year-old. Sarr is reportedly valued at an inflated £45m despite having 18 months left on his Watford contract, so any swap deal would not be easy to pull off without money changing hands. Dennis made 37 appearances for Watford, scoring ten times and providing six assists.
