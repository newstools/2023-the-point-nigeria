BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has stated that he Would declare war on the power sector if elected president in the forthcoming February election. Obi said this on Monday while speaking at the Chatham House in the United Kingdom. He said, “You have heard them say we don’t have structure, that structure is the one that has dismantled Nigeria. We will destroy that structure of criminality, I assure you of it. “We’re going to turn around the power sector. Nigeria today generates 5 or 6,000 megawatts for 200 million people and South Africa, the second biggest in terms of economy on the continent, 60 million people, generates over 40,000 mega watts, yet, they have declared an emergency in the power sector. “I have said it that anyone can generate up to 100,000 megawatts with our licence. “If a country with 60 million population generating over 40,000MW is declaring emergency on power, what do you think somebody with two hundred million people generating 5,000 to 6,000MW will do? War! “I am going to declare war on power and I will solve it. Anybody who stands on the way, so be it.”
