President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Yusha’u Ahmed as the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps. The NYSC Director, Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, confirmed on Sunday that Ahmed will officially be assuming office as the new Director General on Monday. Megwa noted that the Brigadier-General will be taking over from Christy Uba who was named the overseer of the scheme following the removal of the 18th Director General, Muhammad Fadah, in November 2022. “We are going to release a statement tomorrow. The handing-over holds Monday by 11:30 am at NYSC headquarters, Abuja,” he noted. Mrs. Uba is the NYSC Director of Information and Communications Technology and the first woman to lead the agency since its establishment in 1973.
