The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has cancelled the existing Police Community Relations Committee identity cards with effect from December 2022. Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement on Saturday that this is in line with the IGP’s zeal to sanitize and standardize all sectors including the Police Community Relations Committee. He said the IGP has also ordered the redesign and re-issuance of new PCRC identity cards from the Force Headquarters, Abuja, and through judicious screening of membership across board. “The Inspector General of Police hereby directs all eligible members of PCRC nationwide to contact the offices of the various Zonal, Command and Formations PCRC Chairmen as well as the Police Public Relations Officers (PPROs) of their Zones, Commands and Formations respectively to obtain new forms for processing the newly approved ID Card. “The IGP equally directs that hence, anyone found parading himself with the invalidated PCRC ID card should be arrested and prosecuted,” Adejobi added.
