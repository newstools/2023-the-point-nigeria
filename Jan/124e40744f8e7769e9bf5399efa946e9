The operatives of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission on Thursday re-arrested the former Registrar of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Dibu Ojerinde. The ICPC operatives arrested Ojerinde shortly after the hearing before Justice Obiora Egwuatu of a Federal High Court in Abuja where the former JAMB Registrar has been standing trial on an 18-count charge bordering on diversion of public funds to the tune of N5 billion. Ojerinde, who was being led out of the court by one of his sons to the car park after Justice Egwuatu adjourned the trial until February 15, was accosted by the ICPC operatives who whisked him away in their vehicle. It was however gathered that the latest arrest was not connected to the fresh facts emerging from his ongoing trial and made by the fourth prosecution witness, Jimoh Olabisi, the former JAMB Deputy Director of Finance. A reliable source from the commission told NAN that a warrant of arrest for Ojerindeâ€™s re-arrest was obtained from the FHC Chief Judge, Justice John Tsoho. The ICPC had, on July 8, 2021, arraigned the former JAMB registrar on an 18-count charge He was said to have committed the offence during his tenure as registrar of the National Examinations Council and JAMB. Ojerinde, however, pleaded not guilty to all the charges and was later admitted to bail in the sum of N200 million.
